  //What are Futures?
  // These represent values that are not yet ready - but they will be in the future.

  //Why do we use them?
  // If we didn't use them, sometimes our programme would pause and wait for long operations to complete (for example, fetching data from a database or an API).
  // The Future allows us to run tasks in the background (like fetching data), without stopping the whole programme.

  //How do we create them?
  val futureHelloWorld: Future[String] = Future {
    Thread.sleep(2000) //Pausing the thread for 2 seconds
    "Hello Future World!"
  }

  //How can we print these Futures?

  //NOT LIKE LIKE.
  println("Standard print line: " + futureHelloWorld) //This is printing the futures itself, rather than the value.

  // 1st way - use .foreach as a callback
  futureHelloWorld.foreach(result => println(s"Using .foreach: $result"))

  //2nd way - use onComplete (use this when we want to handle success and failure)
  futureHelloWorld.onComplete {
    case Success(result) => println(s"Using onComplete: $result")
    case Failure(exception) => println(s"Failure with onComplete: ${exception.getMessage}")
  }

  //3rd way - using Await.result
  val waitTime: FiniteDuration = Duration(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS) //Wait 5 seconds, if you don't receive the value in 5 seconds, time out.
  println("Using await: " + Await.result(futureHelloWorld, waitTime)) //collect it, print it after you have waited for the time stated.
  //THIS WILL BLOCK THE THREAD (and therefore future cannot be used in parallel).
  //Use when essential.

  println("I'm printed after the futures are called.") //Proving that with .foreach and .onComplete this is printed before, so its happening while we are waiting for the future to be return.

  /** TASK */
  // Write a method called additionInTheFuture that takes in two Ints and returns the addition of the ints in the future.
  //Practice calling and printing the method in different way.

  Thread.sleep(1100) //This will force the thread to sleep before it gets to the .valve in the pattern match which forces it to get the future immediately.

  //This function only cares about deciding if the future completed or not. It will not get us out of the Either. If it completes and receives either Left or the Right, it will be a Success. If the future didn't complete due to a time out, it will hit the None. This is better than our code crashing.
