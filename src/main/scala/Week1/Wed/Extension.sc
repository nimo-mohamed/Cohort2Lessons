//  Extension:
//  Logical operators used in IF statements (e.g., && or <) have an order of precedence.
//1. What is this order, or where can we find it?
//Let's try to apply it, try to predict the answer before coding it:
//  2. What would (true || false && false) result in?
//  3. What about ((true || false) && false)? Note the parentheses used here.
//4. And finally, how about (1 < 4 && 7 != 10 || 9 + 10 == 21)?
