//   Research:
//  If statements always return values. This means we can assign values based on if statements.
//  How would we go about doing this, or where could we search to find out?
//Try out the example below:
//  1. Create two values that hold integers. Assign any integer you'd like to these values.
//2. Create a new value to hold a string and assign it "yes" if the first value is greater than the second,
//and "no" if the second value is greater.
//(Donâ€™t overthink this!)
